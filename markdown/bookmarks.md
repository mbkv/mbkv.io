## game dev

Game development has always been fascinating to me. But, I've found that many of the practices and algorithms used in this field can be opaque and hard to find. Some algorithms are straight forward like axis aligned bounding box collisions. I've even done several implementations of that at my time at Kapwing. But setting up a render graph for the first time is daunting. This is by no means a complete list of things you need to learn in game development. Just stuff I remembered I needed to put on the list

### GPU optimization

- [Life of a triangle - NVIDIA's logical pipeline](https://developer.nvidia.com/content/life-triangle-nvidias-logical-pipeline)
- [Minimum number of triangles per draw call](https://www.g-truc.net/post-0666.html)
- [How bad are small triangles on GPU and why?](https://www.g-truc.net/post-0662.html)
- [Render Graphs](https://logins.github.io/graphics/2021/05/31/RenderGraphs.html)
- [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer)

  contains a huge amount of information about optimization algorithms!

### CPU optimization

- [Pitfalls of Object Oriented Programming](https://harmful.cat-v.org/software/OO_programming/_pdf/Pitfalls_of_Object_Oriented_Programming_GCAP_09.pdf)
- [Pitfalls of Object Oriented Programming, Revisited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAT9E-M-PoE)

  Kind of sensational titles but it really just looks at it from a hardware
  perspective and probably gives the best short introduction to hardware that I know of

### Techniques
- [Handles are the better pointers](https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html)

### Engines

- [tokyospliff's](https://www.youtube.com/@tokyospliff/streams) engine [Hell2024](https://www.youtube.com/@tokyospliff/streams)

  tokyospliff is just a different type of beast

### Graphics

## Browsers

I have been in web apps for my entire engineering career. Most of the things I need to research as of late is obscure. Similarly to gamedev, it also can't be found but for a completely different reason. The majority of web development content on the internet is flat out boring.  It's usually about how you can write the same button but in a different way. That discussion does have its place from time to time, but meaningless. The thing I'm more interested in is how to get that button to render as fast as possible. Below are a few resources for that

- [Web Performance Optimization stats](https://wpostats.com/)

- [Figma's "BUilding a professional design tool on the web](https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/)

  honestly [the entire figma blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/engineering/) is amazing.

  There's more articles linked in the appendix but you'll have to actually
  visit the page to find them :)

Making this section because I don't even know if these are even good resources or what they really are.
